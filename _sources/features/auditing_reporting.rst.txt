Auditing and Reporting
==============


Each labeled dataframe generated by the Wiggum library will have a results table of type Pandas dataframe. This is where the main trends and statistics about your data will be held. The auditing and reporting features in the reproducible_audits class allow you to comment on the results as well as generate reports based on the results. 

The reproducible_audits class is a mixin class designed to handle the features mentioned above. All methods of this class will be called on the labeled dataframe associated with the data being used. 

Annotation 
------------------
The annotation features include:
    - Add a text comment to a row of the results dataframe by creating a new column or adding to an existing one
    - Adding comments by filtering in the following ways
            - feature names
            - feature groups
            - feture sub groups
            - trend types
            - column names
      where the comment will be applied only to the rows represented by the filters
    - Delete comments that were previously added to the data frame

Reporting
------------------

The reporting features include:
    - Generating a report data frame by capturing the current state of the results data frame
        - The columns needed in the report can be chosen based on column indexes
    - Save the report table that you generated 
    - Save a text file with summary statistics based on the current state of the results data frame which includes
        - Number of each sub group present
        - Number of each trend detected
        - Number of reversals/non agreements
        - Number of values above a specified distance threshold 

For example a report pertaining to the Iris Data Set may look like this,

Trends Detected:
